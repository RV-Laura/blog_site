_Special thanks to my husband who had this website template prepared, so I could jump straight into creating._

Hello there. I want to be honest here and say that I didn't know what to write for my first post. So, after a few days pondering on the question, I wanted to just speak from the heart and tackle something less technical: the frustrations that limit an artist's growth.

I am talking about trying to be brave against AI; trying to escape social media's addictive toxicity; trying to rid yourself from the weight of living and make it so it helps you float instead; fighting to take back control over your ability to make your own decisions... because every second counts, and directing your time and effort into what really matters (your family, your friends and yourself) will be the most rewarding feeling you can come across in general. While the body feeds on food and water, the mind does so from thoughts, experiences and feelings. And this is important if any of us want to replace that lack of motivation with the solid driving force to create. Something beyond passion and inspiration.

*Commitment.*

## Personal experiences

In a society with fast evolving technologies, this world slowly has been turning more and more artificial. The food, extremelly processed. The sights washed by tall waves of grey in every city's hearts. The sounds always with that never-ending murmur of an engine nearby. And now, social interaction replaced by likes and comments on Instagram or the rebranded Twitter, X.

Don't get me wrong, I don't hate social media. In fact, these are useful tools for promoting one's self, for contacting friends from afar, or sharing knowledge and humour. But it is sad to see how people use these platforms and tools nowadays. Instead of bringing us together, I feel like we are more distant than ever.

Setting that aside, when I turned 18 and had to choose a bachelor's degree, I went to study... computer science. Yes. It was no where near arts in fact! Well, at that time I was very indecisive and extremelly biased by the idea that to live a stable life you needed a well-paid job. To be honest, I have always been a curious monkey and I find every piece of engineering beautiful and worth invesigating. Having said that, it seemed natural to choose this degree. This is the part where one says, "This was the biggest mistake of my life!" as if it were some YouTube clickbait title, but no. It wasn't a mistake. I grew up with this experience, met really good friends and found the love of my life. Finally I was able to align my thoughts with my core values, and, as silly as it may sound, I was able to understand that a stable life isn't necessarily a happy life. Of course, one can find happiness in a stable life, just how my parents did. But the road I was going down was far from merry.

I am not going to go into detail as to why those years in uni were depressing. I believe it is unnecessary, but what I want to share now is that it is never too late to take action. This year, I quit computer science, after having tried completing the course over the past 6 years, I am getting married and I am planning on continuing this art journey: whether going to an art school or preparing my own portfolio, I do not know exactly. But of course, one has to make sacrifices along the way, since life is like playing Dark Souls on the most difficult of settings. For instance, these days I had applied to an art school and needed to complete an exam to enter, but my current intership related to my computer science degree is offering me a job placement now. I am quite forced to accept this and leave aside the idea of studying at that art school for now because my husband and I need that extra money.

Be that as it may, it is never too late to create or do what you love most. You just have to take action. One step at a time. This is why I started this blog. To hold myself and others accountable, and help us all strive for that happy life.


## AI and social media

Like I mentioned earlier, social media as well as AI can be very useful tools, but the way they are used these days is harmful.

First, let's talk about AI. We are all aware how this tool is able of copying and reproducing styles from different illustrators and musicians; however, this technology is already replacing translators' and programmers' tasks too. If you've watched The Incredibles, you'll remember the scene where the villain Syndrome says, "...when everyone's super... No one will be." Of course, this isn't the meaning Pixar intended to give, but it's an easy and short way to say that AI is to become something normal, deeply integrated in our society, like Google is today. And what will make artists 'super' is our ability to craft evoking scenes with our own two hands. Before, an artist sold paintings, movies, comics... Today, they sell authenticity, care and passion for the love of art.

What AI will do (or is currently doing) is simply mass-produce art pieces, lowering costs. Much like clothes: people buy from Primark or Shein, but when they need something of high-quality, they don't go to these shops. And when they value quality, they become loyal to whatever brand they like (which I promise are not the former shops mentioned). So to overcome this frustration, just value your work, your time, your effort and your skill for what is worth. Well, it has helped me after getting sick of hearing AI over the past years. I hope it helps you too.

Then there's social media. I think these platforms, especially YouTube could be really useful to promote your work, share your progress, and learn from professionals and experienced hobbyists. Nevertheless, it is also plagued with brain-rotting content, addictive designs and toxic gamification of
