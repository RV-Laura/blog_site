<p>Hello, today's post will be about light and how it interacts with our models and our environment (as the title says). So, we'll cover what light is and how it interacts with different surfaces, and we'll also look how shadows are and changed based on different conditions.</p>

<p>One thing I want to mention thought is that you are not required to learn the relevant terminology, but of course this post was written to understand the theory behind light. As long as you understand what is going on without having to name each concept, we are good to go.</p>

<p>So, without further ado, let's talk science...</p>

<h2 id="light">What is light?</h2>

<p>Though quantum physics exist, we are going to treat light as an electromagnetic wave (or just 'wave'... that travels in a straight line). If you think about all the possible colours we can see, we get the typical rainbow or that famous colour wheel, and that is because there is not a single light wave, we are talking about a spectrum of different waves varying in frequency. The colour red has a lower frequency, while the colour violet has a higher frequency. The order in which the colours of the rainbow appear, separates the different light waves by frequency. So, what about white light? Well, white light is all those light waves combined travelling in the same direction, and black is the absence of them all.</p>

<p><em>Insert example image here</em></p>

<p>Now, the sun emits white light. So how do we see red roses, blue birds, green lettuces, etc.? Well, here comes the fun part. The colours that we see in real life are a product of the term "reflection - the light that bounces off a surface". If we see something blue it's because that model's surface reflects that particular blue wave and absorbs the rest of light waves. A tomato is usually red because it reflects that wave corresponding to that red colour, and absorbs the rest. (This is the reason that cold countries use grey and black more often to absorb all the energy from the waves, and hot countries use white and light-coloured pigments to combat the heat by reflecting that light off.)</p>

<p><em>Insert example image here</em></p>

<p>Now that we understand that light is a bundle of different waves of varying frenquencies (which in turn define the varying colours), it's time to understand how it can interact depending on the surface and the angle in which it lands.</p>

<h3 id="reflective_surfaces"> Reflective surfaces </h3>

<p>The idea is simple. If a surface is completely reflective, like a mirror, it will show a virtual (a.k.a fake) simmetrical image. However de plane of simmetry is perpendicular to where the light lands and bounces off. It sounds complicated but it's very intuitive, just grab a small mirror, a spoon or use your phone's reflective surface and play with it around. What does it reflect?</p>

<h3 id="refractive"> The wonders of refraction  </h3>

<p>Refraction occurs when light crosses the boundary between two media (like air-water, air-glass, water-oil, etc.). When the light changes medium, it slows down or speeds up, causing it to bend in one direction or another. Remember having a nice cold drink with a straw or a spoon in it? Did you notice how that straw or spoon would suddenly bend as it touched the liquid? That's refraction. It is essential for us to focus and see properly. The lenses within our eyes refract the light to properly converge the image on our retina. Those with myopia or hypermetropia have their eyes shaped differently, so their lenses do not converge the images right on the retina, hence the need to use glasses to refract the light even further and adjust the point of convergence. Well, I don't really think this will help us improve in art, but it certainly is a fun fact.</p>

<p><em>Insert example image here</em></p>

<p>You can also play with its properties and bend light so much you can create a rainbow. If you think of Pink Floyd's "The dark side of the moon" album cover, you see a transparent prism made of plastic or glass refracting light to such an extent. However, depending on the medium's refractive index and the angle in which light crosses the boundary, we could potentially surpass the critical angle. By doing so, we turn that medium's surface into a mirror, and what was once refractive turns reflective. Think of those breath-taking pictures of lakes with mountains in the distance; does the lake not reflect its landscape like a mirror?</p>

<h3 id="diffraction"> Diffraction  </h3>

<p>There is one more property of waves that we can explore: diffraction. This occurs when a wave crosses a slit narrow enough, it causes the wave to bend by the sides and thus spreads like a fan at most. Anyhow, all these wave phenomenons are interesting to know because us artists have the duty to observe nature and reinterpret it however it resonates with us, and light is such a delicate and complicated thing to portray... yet it also brings life to our creations. Knowledge is power regardless of what we do.</p>
